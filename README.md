## How itâ€™s made

First of all I created three file in Components folder.

- `Square.js`
- `Board.js`
- `Game.js`

In `Square.js` I created the button which will work as square of the game board. I will pass the value using props using other file.

In `Board.js` I created printSquare function which it will take square from square file & I will put into div 9 times so, prefect square will made.

In `Game.js` is main file will hold all logic of the game.
First I have created empty array of 9.

`const boardStart = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''];`

Then I have created 2 useState one History & second currentIndex.
